                What is a Large Language Model?
              </p>
              <p>
                Raki uses a Large Language Model for AI assistance. A Large
                Language Model (LLM) is an AI Model, like the one that powers
                ChatGPT. It basically ingests text and outputs texts. We will
                tell the LLM to find certain datapoints in our text.

              <p>
                You will need to provide an LLM for Raki to use. That sounds
                scary but it is quite straightforward!
              </p>
              <p>
                In this part of the Tutorial we will create an OpenAI Account,
                create an API Key and then configure Raki to use a LLM from
                OpenAI!

                  Here on the dashboard you have a lot of control options. What
                  we need to do is to enable you to use an LLM from OpenAI. It
                  works the following: OpenAI has their trained ready to use
                  LLMs running on their servers. You can send a request to these
                  servers. For example you can ask the model: What should not be
                  missing on a hamburger?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, the server the model is running on needs electricity to
                  run. So running the model actually costs money. So naturally
                  OpenAI wants to earn something by telling you what can&apos;t
                  be missing on a hamburger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The server needs a way to determine who that request is coming
                  from in order to bill you a hundreds of a cent or so to answer
                  your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For that purpose a so called API key is used. We will create
                  one now on the OpenAI Website. This key is then linked to your
                  account.

                <p>
                  So as said, go to the{" "}
                  <span className="font-semibold">Dashboard</span>. Then in the
                  navigation bar on the left at the very bottom there is the
                  option <span className="font-semibold">API Keys</span>. Go to
                  it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then use the{" "}
                  <span className="font-semibold">Create New Secret Key</span>{" "}
                  button. Give the key a name and create it.
                </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now really important you need to save your key somewhere. I
                    usually just create a document on my desktop, call it
                    API-key.docs or whatever and copy the key inside.

                    You cannot access the key after this anymore. But you can
